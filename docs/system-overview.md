# System Overview

This project delivers a casino game application with a poker UI backed by an authoritative realtime server with state machine integration, plus high-speed simulation capabilities for both poker and blackjack. The frontend currently renders poker tables and user interactions; the backend enforces game rules and streams state over WebSockets with comprehensive state machine management. Blackjack is implemented as a backend simulation engine only and does not yet have a UI.

### Shared packages (`packages/`)
- **`packages/shared`**: Shared types and message contracts (Zod-ready, modular)
- **`packages/poker-engine`**: Modular engine with deterministic state transitions
  - **Flow Management**: Hand creation, dealing, betting, street advancement
  - **Strategy Engine**: Hand analysis, preflop analysis, action suggestions
  - **Clean Architecture**: Single responsibility modules under 200 lines
- **State Machine Packages**: Complete state machine implementation for poker games

## Game Types

### Poker
- **Texas Hold'em** with configurable rules
- **Real-time multiplayer** gameplay via game-server with state machines
- **Hand evaluation** and equity calculations
- **Game history** and replay functionality with state machine events
- **Layout editor** for custom table configurations
- **CPU players** for single-player games
- **Modular engine** with clean separation of concerns
- **State machine-driven** game flow with comprehensive validation

### Blackjack
- **Standard blackjack rules** with configurable house rules (backend engine)
- **Multi-deck shoe management** (backend engine)
- **Basic strategy implementation** (backend engine)
- **High-speed Monte Carlo simulations** (backend engine)
- **Bankroll tracking and analysis** (backend engine)
- **Modular simulation engine** with focused responsibilities
- **Note**: Backend-only at this time (no UI or multiplayer server support)

## Simulation Features

The application includes a high-performance simulation runner:

- **Backend Engine**: Pure function simulation engine for maximum performance
- **Web Worker Support**: Background processing capabilities
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: High-volume statistical simulations
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of simulation concerns
- **Status**: Engine implemented; UI to control and visualize simulations is pending

**Note**: While the simulation engine exists and is fully functional, users cannot currently control or run simulations through the interface.

### Simulation Use Cases

- **Strategy Analysis**: Test different playing strategies
- **Rule Impact**: Analyze house rule effects on player advantage
- **Bankroll Management**: Study long-term bankroll behavior
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark game engine performance

## Architecture Flow

### Multiplayer Poker (via Game Server + State Machines)
1. **Client connects** to game-server via WebSocket
2. **Client joins table** and takes a seat
3. **Game server manages** authoritative state via state machines
4. **All actions validated** and processed through state machine engine
5. **State changes persisted** to Convex backend in real-time
6. **State updates broadcast** to all connected clients
7. **Frontend receives updates** via Convex queries and WebSocket events
8. **Real-time synchronization** maintained with state machine validation

### Single-player & Simulations
1. **Local game logic** execution
2. **Web Worker-based** simulations
3. **No server communication** required
4. **Maximum performance** for analysis

## How it works (happy path)

1) **User opens the frontend** (local dev or hosted). The app reads `VITE_WS_URL` and connects to the Socket.IO endpoint.
2) **Client sends** `join_table` (and later `action` events like call/raise/fold).
3) **Server validates messages** through state machines, updates the engine, and emits `state` events with a monotonically increasing sequence number.
4) **State machine events** are automatically persisted to Convex backend for real-time tracking.
5) **Frontend listens to `state`** and updates the UI accordingly. Optional `ack` confirms processed inputs.
6) **Frontend components** can also query state machine data via Convex for hand replay and analysis.
7) **On reconnect**, the client resumes using the last known sequence to catch up.
