## Implementation Details

### State Machine Event Structure

```typescript
// State machine events stored in Convex
interface StateMachineEvent {
  tableId: string;
  handId: number;
  timestamp: number;
  eventType: string;
  fromState: string;
  toState: string;
  context: any;
  metadata?: any;
}

// Game state snapshots
interface GameStateSnapshot {
  tableId: string;
  handId: number;
  timestamp: number;
  gameState: {
    status: string;
    street?: string;
    currentToAct?: number;
    pot: { main: number; sidePots?: Array<{ amount: number; eligibleSeats: number[] }> };
    seats: Array<{
      seatIndex: number;
      stack: number;
      committedThisStreet: number;
      totalCommitted: number;
      hasFolded: boolean;
      isAllIn: boolean;
      hole: string[];
    }>;
    community: string[];
    buttonIndex: number;
    lastAggressorIndex?: number;
    betToCall: number;
    lastRaiseAmount: number;
  };
  trigger?: string;
  actionId?: string;
}
```

### Convex Integration Pattern

```typescript
// State machine adapter captures events and sends to Convex
export class StateMachineAdapter {
  async captureActionProcessed(actionType: string, seatIndex: number, context: any) {
    await this.convex.post('/ingest/stateMachineEvent', {
      eventId: generateEventId(),
      tableId: this.tableId,
      handId: this.currentHand,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      eventType: 'action_processed',
      fromState: 'processing',
      toState: 'processed',
      context: { actionType, seatIndex, ...context }
    });
  }

  async captureGameEvent(eventType: string, context: any) {
    await this.convex.post('/ingest/stateMachineEvent', {
      eventId: generateEventId(),
      tableId: this.tableId,
      handId: this.currentHand,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      eventType,
      fromState: 'active',
      toState: 'active',
      context
    });
  }
}
```

### Frontend Query Pattern

```typescript
// React components query state machine data
const handReplay = useQuery(api.history.getHandReplay, { handId });

// Extract and sort snapshots by timestamp
const snapshots = useMemo(() => {
  if (!handReplay?.gameStateSnapshots) return [];
  return [...handReplay.gameStateSnapshots].sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);
}, [handReplay?.gameStateSnapshots]);
```
